## 💻 How It Works

### Registration
```
1. User visits /register
2. Selects role from dropdown
3. Submits registration form
4. Role validated (must exist)
5. User created with role_id
6. Auto-logged in by Fortify
7. Redirected to role dashboard
```

### Login
```
1. User visits /login
2. Enters credentials
3. Fortify authenticates user
4. Custom redirect handler checks role
5. User redirected to role dashboard
```

### Access
```
- Authenticated users → Automatic redirection by role
- Unauthenticated users → See login/register forms
- Protected dashboards → Require authentication
```
